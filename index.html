      <h2>Come play Disc Golf</h2>
      <p><span class="discgolf">Disc Golf</span> has become a great activity for those who dont concider themselves sporty or athletic. This is a game that anyone can play and the besy part is it's alot more exciting than regular golf. I remember my
        first course it was at my elemetery school when i went there, at the time disc golf was new but it was fun and something i could do causual even though i've never been athletic. A disc golf course can be anywhere schools, colleges, and youth
        areas are great places to find them. You can also find the more pro-type courses in parks and recreational spaces.</p>
      <h3>Our goal</h3>
      <p>We want to help you find the base information you need to play the sport without overwellming you with all the pro activities, but we will tell you how to find them. The In-flight guide will give you information on every disc out there such
        as
        the flight path and other tendencies. We have the basic description of the rules of the game and you can find the rest on the pdga's website.</p>
